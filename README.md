# Toggle Modern Designer for Power Automate!
This chrome extension allows you to toggle the Modern Designer for Power Automate (aka v3).
Toggle once - never worry about it again.

## Installation
Currently this extension is local only (but the store release is on the way!). To install it:
1. Download this repository and unpack it wherever you like
2. In Chrome, go to Settings -> Extensions -> Manage Extensions
3. Toggle Developer Mode
4. Click on "Load Unpacked"
5. Select the downloaded repo file

## Contribute
Contributions are welcome, since this is my first chrome extension in a long time.
